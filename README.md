This code depolys a statiscial analysis via chi square distobution to sort species classifications into their respective 
levels of endargment by analyzing the U.S. National Park Services public observation report database.
This database includes 5,824 species and over 3 million documneted accounts of observations across 4 National Parks:
Yosemite, Yellowstone, Bryce Canyon and The Great Smoky Mountains.

The figure below is the final sorting of all species observed acrosss the four "most sensitive classifications"
Visiual information can be deceptive so I implor everyone to explore the data and code to run their own comparative analysis!

I have left example lines of code in the script for your own exploration, for example:
You can use script prompts to isolate and identify any individual species by refering to it's common or
scientific name.
^^^^^^^^   Refer to the "# Identify bat species" on Line 76 of the code for an example syntax of prompting individual species search.
interactive GUI to come,


Thanks for checking out the code!
