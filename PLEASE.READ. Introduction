This code depolys a statiscial analysis via chi square distobution to sort species classifications into their respective 
levels of endargment by analyzing the U.S. National Park Services public observation report database.
This database includes over 5,000 species and over 23,000 documneted accounts of observations.
The data can be explored via script prompts to isolate and identify any individual species by refering to it's common or
scientific name.
^^^^^^^^   Refer to the "# Identify bat species" on Line 76 of the code for an example syntax of prompting individual species search.
interactive GUI to come,
Thanks for checking out the code!
